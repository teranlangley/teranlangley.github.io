<h1>How To Play Teran's Python Game!</h1>

<p>
This is a game made by me completely in the coding program Python. It is a text-based, turn-based, fighting game in which you choose your attacks turn by
turn in order to fight and hopefully defeat the computer AI. The controls are basic keyboard messages which are laid out for the player along the course
of the game. At any point in the game, you may type "exit" into the input window in order to end the game. Both you and the computer begin with
100 health and each attack will take a bit of your health or the computer until one or the other hits 0, when the game will end. The first question
that will be asked will be the name of the player, the program will call you by this name throughout the rest of the game. Next, you will be 
attacked by a crazy computer and you must decide whether you want to fight back and defend yourself or run away. To make this a little more simple
I have laid it out so that instead of typing out your action each time, you get two or three different options of what you are able to do in the 
situation and to choose which action you want to use you will type in a 1, a 2, or a 3 in the input box. So for this first question since there 
are only two options you will have the option to type in either a 1 or a 2. The next question that will be asked is what attack you would like
to use on your opponent which are a punch, a kick, or if you want to heal some health back. The punch has a lower maximum damage but also has a lower
damage range so it hits more consistent. The kick is the opposite with a higher maximum damage but has a wider damage range so it hits high but only
every so often. When healing, the lower your health the higher the amount of health that will be restored. To punch you have to type 1, to kick type a 
2, to heal type a 3. Okay well those are the basics of the game, so now let's get going and <a href="http://teranlangley.github.io/index.html">play!</p>
